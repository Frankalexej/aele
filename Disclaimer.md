The model structure implemented here (under src/linear_ae_net/) is based on Pretorius et al. (2018):

> Pretorius, A., Kroon, S., & Kamper, H. (2018, July). Learning dynamics of linear denoising autoencoders. In *International Conference on Machine Learning* (pp. 4141-4150). PMLR. https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1806.05413

This repository adapts their linear autoencoder architecture to simulate early phoneme acquisition dynamics.  
All modifications, extensions, and analyses are original and developed for the present study.
